# Overload

This python script uses the built-in `requests` library to constantly make requests to 1000 popular domains.

These domains were taken from OpenDNS's GitHub page (https://github.com/opendns/public-domain-lists/blob/master/opendns-top-domains.txt).

# Usage

Simply download and run `python overload.py` and it will run endlessly.

To cancel the script hit `Ctrl + C`.
